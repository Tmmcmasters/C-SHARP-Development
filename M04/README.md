--EXERCISE 6-8--

Write a program for The Carefree Resort named ResortPrices that prompts the user to enter the number of days for a resort stay. Then display the price per night and the total price. Nightly rates are:

$200 for one or two nights
$180 for three or four nights
$160 for five, six, or seven nights
$145 for eight nights or more
For example, if the input is 1, the output should be:

Price per night is $200.00
Total for 1 night(s) is $200.00
In order to prepend the $ to currency values, the program will need to use the CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo method. In order to do this, include the statement using System.Globalization; at the top of your program and format the output statements as follows: WriteLine("This is an example: {0}", value.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));
